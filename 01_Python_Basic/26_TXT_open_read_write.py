'''
Python has open() function which is used to open a file and returns a file object (file pointer).
The open() function takes two parameters: the file name and the mode in which the file
should be opened. The mode can be 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, 'a' for appending, and 'b' for binary mode.

All types of files can be opened in Python, including text files, binary files (e.g image), and more.

All file modes:
'r'  - Read (default mode). Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist.
'w'  - Write. Opens a file for writing, creates a new file if it does not exist, truncates the file to zero length if it exists.
'x'  - Exclusive creation. Opens a file for writing, creates a new file, and raises an error if the file already exists.
'a'  - Append. Opens a file for appending at the end of the file without truncating it, creates a new file if it does not exist.
'b'  - Binary mode. Opens a file in binary mode (e.g., 'rb' or 'wb').
't'  - Text mode (default). Opens a file in text mode (e.g., 'rt' or 'wt').
'+'  - Read and write. Opens a file for both reading and writing (e.g., 'r+' or 'w+').
'r+' - Read and write. Opens a file for both reading and writing, error if the file does not exist.
'w+' - Write and read. Opens a file for both writing and reading, creates a new file if it does not exist, truncates the file to zero length if it exists.
'x+' - Exclusive creation and read. Opens a file for both writing and reading, creates a new file, and raises an error if the file already exists.
'a+' - Append and read. Opens a file for both appending and reading (e.g., 'a+').

'''
NOTE: if the file has previous contents, then when you open it in write mode ('w'), 
      it will truncate the file to zero length before writing.
      Even if you write nothing to the file, it will still create an empty file !!!!
=> That's why in this part, we use append mode ('a') to avoid truncating the file to zero length.
