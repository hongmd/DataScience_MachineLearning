Immanuel Kant's first Principle of Universalizability:
      
"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

This principle states that before acting, 
you should consider whether the rule guiding your action 
could be applied universally to everyone, without contradiction.
      
If the action cannot be universalized without causing a contradiction or harm, then it is immoral.

Immanuel Kant's second Principle of Universalizability (Formula of Humanity):

"Act so that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, 
always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means."

This principle states that you must treat every person as having intrinsic value,
and never exploit anyone simply as a tool for your own goals.
      
If your action uses someone merely as a means, without respecting their dignity and autonomy, it is immoral.
